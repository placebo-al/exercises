## HIIT  ## 

This drill can be ran indoors or outdoors. You can use equipment or nothing at all. Sky is the limit! I do both. Outside I have a medium sized hill and a bench. Indoors I have a track, stairs, bike, and access to dumbbells. For an outdoor workout substitute any cardio move in place of track or stairs.

For this workout your participants will perform 2 minutes of a slow cardio based movement i.e., Jog/Walk followed by 20 repetitions of a high intensity plyometric move.

When done with the plyometric, they will immediately perform 2 minutes of a fast cardio move ie: Sprint., then finish with a low intensity set of 20 reps.

This repeats and gets harder along the way.

Indoors use track, stairs or bike for the running components.

2 minutes Jog or Walk around track
20 Jump Squats

As many as possible
Concept
Form clients into handicapped teams of four. If you have less than 8 people, form them into smaller groups and adjust reps accordingly.
Teams must complete as many rounds of the circuit as possible (AMRAP) in the given  time. For each round they complete they score one point. Points are added together at the end of the game. Include partial rounds (0.25 points per completed exercise).
The repetitions shown is the TOTAL number of reps the team must complete (eg. 100 reps/4 = ~25 reps each). Fitter clients can do extra for less  fit clients. Teams may only move to the next exercise once ALL reps of the previous exercise have been completed. They cannot be working on two different exercises at the same  time.
The skipping at the end of the circuit is only completed by one member. The team chooses which member is to complete them. The others can rest while they wait for that person to return.
The number of skips is based on the clients skipping ability. Novices do 25 skips, intermediates do 50 skips and skipping masters do 75 skips or 20 double unders.
Between each circuit take a 2 minute rest while you explain the exercises in the following circuit.
Circuits
Circuit 1 – Upper
6 minute AMRAP
80x push ups
80x renegade rows
80x pike push ups
One client skips
Circuit 2 – Lower
6 minutes AMRAP
100x alternating lunges (L+R=2)  80x partner squats
40x jump squats
One client skips
Circuit 3 – Full
8 minutes AMRAP
20x burpee double squat
40x power jacks
60x partner high 5 plank (L+R=1)  One client skips

Kinda Tabata
This workout is kinda Tabata because your clients will be working with 20 seconds on, 20 seconds o  intervals.
Plan
Round 1 – Practice
Spend some  me going through each exercise explaining the common mistakes on each one. Then rotate clients through each station for about 20 seconds each to ensure that they are familiar with each drill.
Round 2 – Strength
Split clients into pairs, preferably with someone of a similar fitness level so that they push each other appropriately.
Pairs will pick an exercise to start on. Clients will perform the exercise in intervals of 20 seconds on/20 seconds off. 
One partner will be exercising while the other rests.
Another 3 rounds each (a total of 120 seconds) rotate the clients around to the next exercise.
Here is a suggested list of exercises:
Exercise
1. Dead Ball Slams
2. Glute Bridge Marches
3. Bear Crawl
4. KB Deadlift  Jumps
5. Push Ups
6. Dead Ball Situps
7. Wall Assisted Handstand Hold - hold for 20s on/20s o 
8. KB Goblet Alternating Lateral Lunge

Take 10
This workout contains 3 or more parts. The Counter, Drill A and Drill B.
You can add more drills if you like (C, D etc) for more variety or a longer workout.
The Counter
Use this drill to keep track of how many rounds a client has done. It should increment by one each round.
Drills A, B and C
These can be anything really. I chose one to be a muscular strength circuit, another to be a cardio circuit and a  final one something fun.
Alternate between drills in between each round of the Counter (see below for example).
Example The Counter
I set the Counter as a Manmaker.
Round 1 clients with 1 manmaker, round 2 they did 2 manmakers.
Each round they added an additional manmaker until the  final round of 10.
Drill A
Perform 10 reps of each exercise. Advanced clients should perform 15 reps each.
1. T Push Ups
2. Bent Over DB Rows
3. DB Goblet Squat
Drill B
Perform 10 reps of each exercise. Advanced clients should perform 15 reps each.
1. DB Jumping Jacks
2. Mountain Climbers (L+R=1)
3. Donkey Kicks
Drill C
Shuttle Runs: Run across the room (10-20m) and back 5 times.

When the workout is completed in order it would look like this:
1x manmaker
Drill A – strength circuit
2x manmaker
Drill B – cardio circuit
3x manmaker
Drill C – shuttles
4x manmaker
Drill A
5x manmaker
Drill B
6x manmaker
Drill C
7x manmaker
Drill A
8x manmaker
Drill B
9x manmaker
Drill C
10x manmaker
Drill A

Zombiefit 2
Teamwork Drill Plank Race

Split clients into two even groups. Line up one team of clients side by side in plank shoulder to shoulder. Line up the other team, also in plank but facing the  first team. The end client hops up and runs to the other end and then gets down in plank. Once down on the ground they yell “Go!”. Then the next person gets up and runs over.
Proceed for 90 seconds in one direction, ensuring that clients stay shoulder to shoulder. Then return for 90 seconds in the other direction, this  me doing a straight arm plank.
EMOM
The Counter
EMOM means every minute on the minute. At the start of the every minute, clients must perform push ups, nose to knees and squats. After completing the required number of reps they get to rest for the rest of the minute.
Failure to complete a round inside the  me limit means that the client will  finish the repetitions for that round, then do 2 burpees, then rest for the rest of the minute and then join back in the following round.
First 5 minutes: 5 push ups, 4 nose to knee, 5 squats Next 5 minutes: 5 push ups, 4 nose to knee, 10 squats Next 5 minutes: 5 push ups, 10 nose to knee, 10 squats Last 5 minutes: 10 push ups, 10 nose to knee, 10 squats Nose to knee reps: (L+R=2)
Total  me = 20 minutes. Do not stop between 5 minute increments.
Variations
Beginners: Have them follow this alternative.
First 10 minutes: 5 push ups, 4 nose to knee, 5 squats Last 10 minutes: 5 push ups, 4 nose to knee, 10 squats Advanced: Add two Burpees to the 3 exercises
